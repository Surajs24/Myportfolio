          <h2>Mechanical engineer/Aspiring web developer/Entrepreneur</h2>

          <p>
            I am a Mechanical Engineer currently pursuing a Masters in
            Mechanical Engineering. I love to be occupied with challenges that
            push me to learn and develop new skills. Through years of practicing
            mindfulness, I have learnt to focus my attention on to various tasks
            throughout my life enabling me to produce results and solve problems
            on a range of fronts at once. Having had responsibility on my
            shoulders from very early on in my life I often find myself taking
            on a leading role in groups, as I am able to focus on my goals and
            quickly put aside differences to find a way to make it work for
            everyone. I can work exceptionally in a variety of roles. I am
            willing to go the extra mile and put the effort in. I am fortunate
            to have traveled a lot and met a very diverse range of people which
            has helped me become approachable, taught me excellent communication
            skills, and developed my empathy and teamworking ability. I adapt
            very quickly to new challenges.

            <h3>Modelling a single cylinder GDI and HCCI engine</h3>
            <p>
              Modelled, calibrated, and improved a one-dimensional GDI and HCCI
              single cylinder engine using AVL Boost. Simulated the combustion
              inside a single cylinder and got a solid foundation of the science
              behind combustion principles and reducing greenhouse emissions.

            <h3>Factory in a box</h3>
            <p>
              Designed the layout and selected Robots for a factory in a box
              that autonomously assembles an XYZ table, simulated the FIAB using
              ROBO DK and conducted a literature review with a focus on using
              digital twins for predictive maintenance which has equipped me
              with the skills to automate production.

            <h3>Flood response vehicle</h3>
            <p>
              Developed ergonomic and safety factors for a flood response
              vehicle, modelling my solutions using SOLIDWORKS and specified the
              details to manufacture the vehicle with plan of action to
              implement safety features. This enabled me to sharpen my skills
              with solid works and intricacies of designing for the 99th
              percentile human.

            <h3>Production of medical grade components</h3>
            <p>
              Generated CAM programs for three complex medical components using
              Fusion 360 CAM and produced control charts to select the
              appropriate machine for production. This gave me a deeper insight
              that built upon my existing production skills and helped me learn
              how to control the production process.

              Led a group of seven where each group was part of a bigger team
              consisting of 32 people on a project to design a smart tram for
              Cardiff. Over the course of the entire project the focus was on
              the UNCC’s goals for sustainability. This project especially
              helped me build my leadership and management skills.

              <ul>
                <li>
                  Led a Project to produce rotor cores for ventilator motors for
                  a hospital in LA during the pandemic. 300 rotor cores were
                  delivered on time. Reduced the overall cycle time by 43% with
                  in the first week of production.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Designed an apparatus using Solid works from concept to final
                  design to inspect workpieces near the machine and minimized
                  downtime by eliminating a non-value step of transportation for
                  each component by 5 minutes.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Explored possibilities of using an old unused ROMER semi robot
                  arm for inspection purposes and submitted a standard operating
                  procedure to use it along with PC-DIMS which reduced the time
                  spent to inspect components by 25%.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Researched data analysis methods and improved the data
                  collection process by using pivot tables and automated
                  efficient visualization of data to be presented to corporate
                  using Excel.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Played a pivotal part in a team which introduced a lean
                  manufacturing concept called 2-bin system to make sure parts
                  were available to be pulled from shop floor when required
                  instead of the traditional push method.
